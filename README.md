# Overview

In this analysis, I am trying to help us understand which between JP Morgan & Chase and The Goldman Sachs has a good record on the stock market. Also, I will want to determine who is doing good currently.   

There are two datasets in this project. One for JP Morgan & Chase and the other for The Goldman Sachs. The datasets contain records of of stock market prices for both firms from 2000 to April 2023. There is low and high stock prices and the quantity of share sold due to security for each date.

Making this analysis will investors understand trends on the stock market about those firms. Thus, they will be able to make better investment decisions. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

#### QUESTION 1
##### Compare which company traded most shares or contracts due to security from 2000 to 2023

We can clearly see that JP Morgan & Chase (JPMC) sold a great deal more shares than Goldman Sachs (GS) from 2000 to 2023. In 2000, while GS sold less than 5 thousands JPMC sold 2 million. There was a huge gap in comparison of the volume of shares sold by JPMC to GS. The same pattern goes till 2023. This means that investors are more tuned to buy JPMC stocks that GS.

#### QUESTION 2
##### Compare the total number of shares traded by company Since 2000.

Naturally, as we have seen above, JPMC more than 119 trillion shares due to security while GS just sold over 30 billion.

#### QUESTION 3
##### Which Company had the lowest and highest stock market prices in 2023

GS both on high and low stock prices is higher than JPMC. That means that GS stocks are more expensive than JPMC which explains our results from question 1 and 2. There are more shares sold by JPMC because they are less expensive than GS.
